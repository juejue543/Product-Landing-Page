#LinenLoom: A Product Landing Page 
##Overview
This project is the culmination of my first task in the Sync Intern's Bootcamp. The task required coding a product landing page using vanilla HTML and CSS. Taking inspiration from landing pages found on [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/) and popular product landing websites, I created a landing page for the fictional brand "LinenLoom".

## Features
1. **Responsive Design**: The landing page is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
2. **Animation**: Incorporates visually appealing marquee scrolling animation to enhance user engagement.
