Hello and Welcome!


This is the first task in my Sync Intern's Bootcamp!
The task is basically to code a product landing page using HTML and CSS. For this one, i was heavily inspired by https://dovetail.com/. 
Infact, you could say that this project is basically a clone of the product landing page of https://dovetail.com/! So credits to them for the design and everything.
